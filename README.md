# Twitter Click'n'Save

This userscript allows you to save media content (images, videos) from Twitter's tweets by just a click on a button which appears over the media in tweets.

The content saves (downloads) with the most appropriate filename. The userscript also keeps download history, so you will not download some media twice if you do not want it.
