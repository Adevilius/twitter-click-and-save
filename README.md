# Twitter Click'n'Save

This userscript allows you to save media content (images, videos) from Twitter's tweets by just a click on a button which appears over the media in tweets.

The content saves (downloads) with the most appropriate filename. The userscript also keeps the download history, so you will not download some media twice if you do not want it. 

## Additional enhancements
- Makes links direct in tweets and in the browser title
- Highlight visited links
- Automatically expands spoilers
- Hides: sign up bar, sign up section; trends; topics to follow
